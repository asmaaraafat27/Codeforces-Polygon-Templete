# Validation and Generation Tools for Codeforces Contests
#### This repository contains a collection of tools to help with Codeforces contest preparation. it includes:

- A validator to check the correctness of test input and output files.
- A test case generator to create new test cases for a problem.
- A checker to verify the correctness of a submission's output against the expected output.

#### Validator:
The validator script, validator.cpp, takes two arguments: a path to the input file and a path to the output file. It checks that the output file is correct for the given input file according to the problem constraints.

#### Generator:
The test case generator script, generator.cpp, creates new test cases for a given problem. It takes as input the problem constraints and outputs a set of valid input and output files.

#### Checker:
The checker script, checker.cpp, takes two arguments: a path to the expected output file and a path to the actual output file generated by a submission. It verifies that the actual output matches the expected output.
